Nested If Statement: Create a nested if statement (the second if statement will only run if the first one evaluates to true) that does the following:
The first if statement will check to see if num1 is greater than or equal to num2 . If the first if statement evaluates to true, then check to see if num3 is greater than or equal to num4.

Once you’ve created the nested if statement, add the following using console.log():
If both conditions are true, print: “Both statements are true.” If the first condition is true but the second is false, print: “The first statement is true, but the second is not.” In all cases, after the outer if statement, print “Program ended.”
