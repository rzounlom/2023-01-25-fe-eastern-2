This is a small repo to help you run JS code more effiently in your local environment

Prerequisits: You should have Git and NodeJs installed on your local machine
-Install pre-requisits: navigate to the Git/NodeJS download sites and follow the instructions for you OS
--Git - https://git-scm.com/downloads
--NodeJS - https://nodejs.org/en/download/

-Test installations
--Git - run command: git --version
--NodeJs - run command: node --version
--both Git and NodeJS at the same time - run command: git --version && node --version (NOTE: the commands will be run in the order you call them)

Running the applicaion/files

1. install dependencies - run the command: npm install
2. Install nodemon on your local machine:
   -Mac run the command: sudo npm i -g nodemon
   NOTE: enter the password for you Macbook when prompted
   -Windows: you can run the command without sudo: npm i -g nodemon
3. run nodemon - open a terminal in the root of the project and run the following command: nodemon <pathToFile>/<fileName.js>
   For example if your file is in the week1 folder, your command would be nodemon week1/<fileName.js>

   NOTE: running nodemon without a file name specified will run the index.js file, as that is the entry point of the application
