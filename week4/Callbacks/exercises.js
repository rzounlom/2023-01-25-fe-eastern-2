/**Exercise: Create two callback functions, one for adding two numbers, and one for subtracting two values.
Using a callback function, return the final calculation of an array of numbers.*/
//setup arrays
const myNums = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1];
const myNums2 = [510, 1, 1, 2, 1];

//step 1: create a function called addNumbers that takes in two parameters, a and b, and returns the sum of a plus b

//step 2: create a function called subtractNumbers that takes in two parameters, a and b, and returns the sum of a minus b

/*create a function called calculateNUms that takes in an array, arr (default arr to an empty array),  and a callback function, func.
Within the function, use the callback function(func) on each value in the array, and returns the total value.
HINT: declare a variable called sum and use it to store the calucation of each iteration
HINT: use a loop
